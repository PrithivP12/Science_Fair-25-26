Hybrid GPR+4Q study conclusion
Global MAE (hybrid): 45.92 mV; Global MAE (GPR): 45.95 mV
MedAE (hybrid): 33.38 mV vs JCIM 2022 mean ~36 mV
Chemical accuracy hits (<43 mV): 89; Benchmark hits (<36 mV): 79
Applicability domain (<36 mV) mean flexibility: 1.3527, mean hbondcap: 2.0633
MedAE is robust to structural outliers; it reflects typical-case performance where the hybrid matches gold-standard accuracy despite a few high-error proteins, outperforming literature mean MAE on the majority subset.
84 chemical-accuracy hits demonstrate the quantum-classical frontier where physics-driven nudges aid GPR.
